            Ageratum(whiteweed in the USA), is
      a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical and warm temperate flowering
      annuals and perennials from the family Asteraceae,
      tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
      America and Mexico but four are native to the United
      States.[3]

      They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height
      of 30 in. The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or
      tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate.
      The leaves form compact clusters.

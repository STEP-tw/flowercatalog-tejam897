    <p id = 'para1'><b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
    Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
    the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
    <b>Abeliophyllum distichum</b> Nakai, endemic to Korea,
    where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
    seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
    white, not yellow, flowers.</p>
    <p>
      It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
      are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
      pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced
      in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
      are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
      corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm diameter.
